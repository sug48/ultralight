            <h1>Almost Linguine and Clams</h1>
            <p>
                On Tuesday, January 16th, 2024, I wanted soup for dinner because it was cold and snowy, but didn't get started early enough soaking beans and making veggie stock. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Craving comfort but needing something that would cook quickly, I settled on a soupy linguine with clams, even though I didn't have linguine on hand. Or clams, or wine, or herbs. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                <strong>Follow these steps carefully and closely</strong> to make a dish that is almost linguine and clams, precisely like I did.

            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>A dozen clams per person</li>
                <li>Smoked blue fish, 1/3 pound</li>
                <li>Pasta, 1 opened box</li>
                <li>Garlic, whatever's left</li>
                <li>Butter, unmelted</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Dry white wine</li>
                <li>Gremolata 
                    <br />
                    <em class="commentary">(Usually you're supposed to use fresh herbs like parsely. I think basil is nice too in that case, even some capers.)</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    On the way back from the gym, stop at the wine store and get some wine. Ask for a bottle of Italian stuff you won't feel bad cooking with. It's the guy at the register's first day, so make encouraing small talk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stop at the fish market. Get clams, a piece of smoked bluefish, and frozen gremolata.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shovel the walkway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take a shower.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put on some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppJOrnVtkg&list=PL6FDEROH5AJvrs5MVsDlIS9R2lVIULFFE" aria-label>jazz</a>! Don't skip this step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make 2 to 4 oz of pasta per person. What do you have around? Orchiette? How about orchiette? Italian for little ears. It's supposed to be linguine, but a bite size pasta is better for a soupy dish anyway. Say something kind to the ears.         
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a reasonable amount of olive oil and butter in a 12-inch pan with a matching lid. Set the lid aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add chopped garlic, I don't know like a couple cloves?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring 1/2 cup of wine for each dozen clams to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eat some of the smoked blue fish directly off the paper it's wrapped in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rinse the clams. Use your fingers to scrape away grit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add some salt and a spoonful of gremolata to the pan. Eyeball it, how's it looking? Maybe a little more wine? Eat some blue fish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add clams to the pan being careful not to splash your liquid everywhere. Cover until you hear popping subside. Those are the clams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take clams out of pan. Dump pasta in the sauce and let it hang out in there for a little bit, warming up. Remember: soupy. Add a little water or wine if you need to. Remove from heat and throw in a big pat of butter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the soupy pasta in a big bowl. Put all the clams on top.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </main>
