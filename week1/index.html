    <h1>Orchiette and Clams, 01/16/2024</h1>

    <p>
        On Tuesday, January 16th, 2024 I wanted soup for dinner but didn't get started early enough soaking beans and making veggie stock. 
        I wanted something quick and comforting, so I settled on a soupy linguine with clams, even though I didn't have linguine on hand. 
        Or clams, or wine, or herbs. 
        What follows is a set of instructions for making linguine and clams just like I did.
    </p>

    <p>Remember, cooking is like jazz: all the best stuff comes from improvising and perfectionism is no fun.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A dozen clams per person</li>
        <li>Smoked blue fish</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Dry white wine <em>*I used Piccolo Ernesto Gavi because the guy at the wine store recommended it for the dish. It's Italian. Is Gavi a type of wine? <a href="mailto:m@sugarman.zone">Lmk your best guess.</a>*</em></li>
        <li>Gremolata <em>*Usually you're supposed to use fresh parseley. Basil is nice too. Throw some capers in if you're not using gremolata.*</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On the way back from the gym, stop at the wine store. 
            Ask for a bottle of dry white wine you won't feel bad cooking with. 
            Then ask the guy for a recommendation of a medium-bodied, unique red for another time.
             He might go "uhhh" so say you like Cab Franc. 
            He'll describe two bottles. 
            One of those descriptions is made up of almost totally unrecognizable names of grapes and places. 
            Choose that one.
            It's the guy at the register's first day, so make encouraing small talk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stop at the fish market. 
            Exhange two identical rounds of "hi how are you" the fishmonger about three minutes apart.
            Get a dozen clams per person, a piece of smoked bluefish, and frozen gremolata.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shovel the driveway.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a shower.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make 2 to 4 oz of pasta per person, how about orchiette?
            Italian for little ears.
            It's supposed to be linguine, but a bite size pasta is better for a soupy dish anyway.
            Say something kind to the ears.         
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a mix of olive oil and butter in a 12-inch pan with a matching lid. Set the lid aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chopped garlic, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring 1/2 cup of wine for each dozen clams to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Eat some of the smoked blue fish directly off the paper it's wrapped in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse the clams.
            Use your fingers to make sure you get rid of any gritty stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add some salt and a spoonful of gremolata to the pan, maybe a little more wine?
        </li>
        <li>
            Add clams to the pan being careful not to splash your liquid everywhere.
            Cover until you hear popping subside.
            Those are the clams.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take clams out of pan.
            Dump pasta in the liquid and let it hang out in there for a little bit.
            Remember: soupy. Add a little water or wine if you need to.
            Throw in a big pat of butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the soupy pasta in a big bowl.
            Put all the clams on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a fork to pry the clams out of the shells and a big spoon to enjoy the rest.
        </li>
    </ol>
